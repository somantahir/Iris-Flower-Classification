# Iris-Flower-Classification

In this article, we have written a simple logistic regression algorithm to classify an iris species as either ( virginica, setosa, or versicolor) based off of the pedal length, pedal height, sepal length, and sepal height using Logistic Regression Model. Libraries used in this project are matplotlib, seaborn and sklearn.
